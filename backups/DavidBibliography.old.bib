                  drawing D(G) is a configuration of G on the plane in
                  such a way that each edge is composed of horizontal
                  and vertical segments. This paper concerns with
                  reduction of the number of segments. as a main
                  result, it is proved by presenting a linear time and
                  space construction algorithm that any graph has a
                  rectilinear drawing such that the total number of
                  segments is no more than 3E. It is shown that the
                  4-regural bipartite graph needs this number of
                  segment.}
